        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I have many interests on Science. One of the most popular science I know is Vedic Astrology. Below are some of the things about Vedic Astrology.</p>
        <div class="row">
            <div class="course-col">

                <h3> Introduction to Vedic Astrology</h3>
                <p> Jyotisha or Jyotishya (from Sanskrit jyotiṣa, from jyóti- "light, heavenly body") is the traditional Hindu system of astrology, also known as Hindu astrology, Indian astrology and more recently Vedic astrology. The term Hindu astrology has been in use as the English equivalent of Jyotiṣa since the early 19th century, whereas Vedic astrology is a relatively recent term, entering common usage in the 1970s with self-help publications on Āyurveda or yoga.</p>
                <br> <br>

                <h3>Western and Hindu Beliefs </h3>
                <p> Some western as well as Indian scholars believe that the horoscopic astrology practiced in the Indian subcontinent came from Hellenistic influences, post-dating the Vedic period and the Vedanga Jyotisha, one of the earliest texts about astronomy within the Vedas However, this is a point of intense debate and many Indian scholars believe that Jyotisha developed independently although it may have interacted with Greek astrology.</p>
                <br> <br>

                <h3>Following Judgment</h3>
                <p>Following a judgement of the Andhra Pradesh High Court in 2001 which favoured astrology, some Indian universities now offer advanced degrees in Hindu astrology. The scientific consensus is that astrology is a pseudoscience.</p>
